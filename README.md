2. 4 x LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
3. 2 x Servo Motor
4. 1 x Solar Panel
5. Resistors and connecting wires


### Smart Irrigation System
#### Components
1. 1 x Arduino Uno
2. 1 x GSM900A Module
3. 1 x Relay Module
4. 1 x Water Pump Motor
5. 1 x LDR Sensor
6. 1 x Soil Moisture Sensor
7. 1 x 16x2 LCD Display
7. 1 x SIM Card
9. Resistors and connecting wires

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SOLAR-POWERED-WIRELESS-IRRIGATION-MONITORING.git
2. Open the respective project folder.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.


## Usage
1. Assemble the circuit as per the provided diagrams.
2. Power on the systems.
3. For the Dual Axis Solar Tracking System, observe the solar panel adjusting its position to maximize sunlight exposure.
4. For the Smart Irrigation System, monitor the soil moisture and light levels on the LCD display and receive SMS notifications about the irrigation status.
